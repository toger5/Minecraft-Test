# Test of a minecraft clone

I programmed a minecraft style voxel game with the blender game engine. The world is generated with a noise map and blocks are only builded where they are needed. But still the performance is poor. But if you want to you can try it out and build a little house go ahead ;)  !
there are still a lot of bugs and the project needs some more work. Also the bledner game engine might not be the perfect tool for a vokel game ;) .
To try it out you need to download all files (into the same directory) and start the minecraft2.blend file.
