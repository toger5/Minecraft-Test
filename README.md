# Test of a minecraft clone

I programmed a minecraft style voxel game with the blender game engine. The world is generated with a noise map and blocks are only builded where they are needed. If you want to you can try it out and build a little house, go ahead ;)  ! The Bledner game engine might not be the perfect tool for a voxel game ;).
The reason is that the bledner game engine doesn't support mesh editing during runtime.
This is the reason why i switched to the Godot game engine. Check out the godot voxel repository. [Godot-Voxel-Game-MineCraftClone](https://github.com/toger5/Godot-Voxel-Game-MineCraftClone)

To try it out you need to download all files (into the same directory) and start the minecraft2.blend file.
